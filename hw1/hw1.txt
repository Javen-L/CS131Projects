Tried loops, realized loops were not allowed
Used List library to make methods simpler
equal_set uses subset
	equal sets are subsets of each other
set_union does not produce a list with unique elements
	some elements are repeated, since allowed in set
	uses List.append
set_intersection uses opposite condition of set_diff
computed_fixed_point is recursive to be able to compute infinite times
computed_fixed_point loops inifinitely if no fixed point, because uses infinite tries
filter_reachable conatins multiple helper methods
	Two methods to parse tuples
	One recursive method to parse grammar
		Tried to keep all the rules on each function call, but that caused endless loop
